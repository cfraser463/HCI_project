    <h2>Project Proposal:</h2>
    <h2>Order To Go</h2>
    
    <div class="bubble">
        <h2>PROBLEM: </h2>
        <p>For quite a long time, students of the St. Augustine faction of the University of the West Indies (U.W.I) have found the task of spending a long period of time in lines for food particularly tedious. Sometimes after spending up to thirty (30) minutes in the line at various food outlets, there is a tendency of hearing that the option requested is not available. This proves to be quite frustrating for students.</p>

        <h2>GOALS/AIMS OF SYSTEM: </h2>
        <p>
            To solve this, users will be able to precisely make their order and receive instant feedback depending on order availability and preparation time. This will eliminate  the time spent in long lines and the process of face to face ordering of food, reducing human error and saving time for more productive endeavors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This system will be implemented using a mobile application on Android devices. The user will be able to look through food outlets around campus and can choose one. The user will be able to see all available items at the food outlet in real time, choose desired items and prepare an order, seeing the estimated time and cost to prepare the order. User will be given instant feedback when orders are placed and the location of the food outlet to pick up the order. Users will also have the option of receiving email notifications when orders are ready. User will be able to make payments through the app using online payments, if the user does not have access to online payment systems such as credit cards then the user will be given the option to load their user account with funds using self-service cash registers around campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective of this project was to solve this issue of waiting in lines and the time spent placing and receiving orders. This project is also beneficial to food outlets as they would not need to employ staff members to take orders and the time saved on receiving orders could be used to produce larger orders at faster rates.

        <h2>TARGET USERS: </h2>
        <p>
            This system will also be used to improve efficiency by saving time and reducing human errors and is targeted to the students of the University of the West Indies to place and order for food on campus and be able to pick up the orders at various food outlets such as KFC, Mario’s, Subway and even Yvette’s around campus.

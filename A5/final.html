        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>
            For quite a long time, students of the St. Augustine faction of the University of the West Indies (U.W.I) have found the task of spending a long period of time in lines for food particularly tedious. Sometimes after spending up to thirty (30) minutes in the line at various food outlets, there is a tendency of hearing that the option requested is not available. This proves to be quite frustrating for students and can be simply avoided by use a technology based solution. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Our solution to this is an mobile application, Order To Go, where users would be able to order meals from food outlets on campus through the mobile app and pick up orders after they are completed, eliminating wait times at lines. 
        </p>

        <h2>Design Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Waiting in lines to buy food can be long and tedious. Not only is the time spent waiting a cause of frustration but there is also the fact there is now way to estimate how long the wait can take until you arrive at the food outlet. There is also the issue that after this long wait your intended order may be unavailable.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bubble">
        <h2>User Research and Findings</h2>
        <p>
           Three research methods were used in order to gather data from potential users. This data allowed us to determine the viability of the product and also what was expected of it. The methods used were Questionnaires, Interviews and Paper prototyping. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The questionnaires which were distributed to mainly students indicated that many students do experience the problem with fast food outlets as described above. It was also found that they would be willing to benefit from a technology based solution in the form of a mobile application to aid in their food purchases.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The interviews and paper prototypes were conducted to both students and a current food outlet manager in order to get perspective of both types of user of the system. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Students/Potential customers indicated that they wanted to have the ability to walk through all the specific aspects of a meal ( drinks, sides, toppings etc.) . Another valuable feature to them was knowing how long it will take before they can collect their meal. Many indicated that they would also like a delivery option. 

        </p>
        <p>
            From interviewing the manager of maco taco the insight was given that there were 2 important tasks: Seeing all the transactions made, pending and in progress along with the ability to fully create and customize their menu. Since this technology was to be used while performing their daily duties, emphasis was placed on importance of simplicity in the design of the system
        </p>

        <h2>Design and Justification</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the feedback mentioned above a mobile Android application was chosen as the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 2 main types of users : Student/Customer users and Food outlet users.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were several tasks related to each type of user as stated below:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Student/Customer user
        </p>
        <p>
            - Customize and specify the order to their preference
        </p>
        <p>
            - Be indicated as to whether or not an outlet was closed or if a menu item was unavailable
        </p>
        <p>
            - Be indicated as to how long the expected wait for receiving their order would be
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>
            Food outlet user
        </p>
        <p>- View past and pending transactions</p>
        <p>- Ability to customize the menu </p>
        
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="bubble">
        <h2>Heuristic Evaluation and Findings</h2>
        <p>
            In our heuristic analysis the core task of ordering a meal using the Order To Go App was evaluated. The evaluator moved through 5 screens where they selected a restaurant, chose their desired order, customizing/ finalizing the order and placing the order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this analysis three major problems and 6 minor issues were found. The main problem found were navigation issues where users found difficulty finding restaurants or back to specific pages. Our solution to this was the proposed addition of navigation and search bars for users to find and located specific sections of the application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Minor issues were mainly user interface problems such as text sizes, screen colours and sorting of lists for which there were simple solutions for and were implemented. 
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bubble">
        <h2>Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design</h2>
        <p>
            -     Implementation of the Food outlet side of the application .
            This will incorporate the functionality of a user not being able to cancel an order after a food outlet user indicates that they have started preparing the meal.
            This part of the application will also allow food outlets to create and customize the menu to present to customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            -     The project could be extended by implementing more features such as delivery service from the various restaurants and possible implementation of the Order To Go functionality on other school campuses (e.g. UTT, SBCS etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
            -     The system can also be implemented on IOS to include more possible users to benefit from its functions
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bubble">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
           After getting feedback from target user groups it was shown that there is a need and a want for a technology based food ordering service on campus that will improve the experience for customers and will improve efficiency in food outlets. This technology in the form of mobile android application was drafted and created and tested and was shown as a viable solution that can be implemented.

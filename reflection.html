            Most of our research methods were successful as we were able to meet most of the expectations of the test users through our research methods. From these research methods valuable information on user expectations for the application and feedback on design prototypes were obtained and stated in major findings. One area of improvement is research from a wider array of food outlets would greatly benefit our study as smaller food outlets would have different needs to larger food outlets. Using information gathered from our current paper prototypes, updated prototypes for testing would also improve our findings.

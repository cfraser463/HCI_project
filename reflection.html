            Most of our research methods were successful as we were able to meet most of the expectations of the test users through our research methods. From these research methods valuable information on user expectations for the application and feedback on design prototypes were obtained and stated in major findings. 
        </p>

            One area of improvement is research from a wider array of food outlets which would greatly benefit our study as smaller food outlets would have different needs to larger food outlets. Using information gathered from our current paper prototypes, updated prototypes for testing would also improve our findings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another area of improvement would have been to have recorded interviews with a voice recorder rather than written only so as to not miss any feedback given and for other members who were not present to get a more in depth understanding when analysing results.

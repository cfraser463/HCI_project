        <h2><i>Justification</i></h2>
        <p>Interviews were done with both the perspectives of the common student user and food outlet user. This was done as the interface is will have different scenarios for each type of user.
            This method allowed for interviewees to give detailed descriptions of their expectations for the system.

        <h2><em>Method/Findings:</em></h2><br>
        <h4><em>Student/Customer User-</em></h4>
        <p>
            A face to face interview was done with a student in order for them to give as much clarifications of their expectations of the system.<br>
            Our major findings are as follows:<br>
            ●	Location of the businesses should be clearly displayed.<br>
            ●	Transaction information should be available.<br>
            ●	Menus should have combos and the ability to add sides/extras.<br>
            ●	There should be the option for delivery or to pay at the counter.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h4><em>Food Outlet User-</em></h4>
        
        <p>
            A face to face interview was done with the operator of the Maco Taco food outlet. After explaining the general idea of the project she was asked what her expectations of the system would be. <br>
            Our major findings are as follows:<br>
            ●	It should be easy to use for someone who is not “tech savy”.<br>
            ●	A fully customizable menu ( from the perspective of the business owner).<br>
            ●	A secure system of payment.<br>
            ●	The ability to see all transactions and track food outlet statistics over a period of time.<br>
            ●	A discount program for regular customers.<br>

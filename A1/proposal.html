    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <div class="bubble">
        <h3>Topic choosen</h3>
        <p>App/Service for UWI students to order food on campus and be able to pick up orders at food outlets around campus.</p> <br>
        <h3>Reason</h3>
        <p>
            As a student I also face the problem of spending up to 30 minutes in lines waiting in lines for food sometimes only to hear that the option I wanted is not available. This idea was chosen to solve that problem of waiting in long lines and the time spent placing and receiving orders. With this service lines will be eliminated and precise orders can be made, giving time for more productive endeavours. This idea is also the most useful of the 3 brainstormed ideas based on preliminary questions to UWI Students.

            This article looks at the ordering of food at a restaurant from mobile devices to improve efficiency by saving time, reducing human errors and real time customer feedback. This directly relates to my proposed idea of a food ordering system but with the addition of ordering from multiple food outlets in a University campus.

        <h2>Requirements and justification</h2>
        <p>
            Users will be able to precisely make their order using a mobile application and receive instant feedback on if the desired order is available, the time to prepare the order and the location of the food outlet to receive the order. This will eliminate the time spent in long lines and the process of face to face ordering of food, reducing human error and saving time for more productive endeavours. Users will have the option of online payment through the app or cash payments through automated cash registers around campus. This project is also beneficial to food outlets as they would not need to employ staff members to take orders and the time saved on receiving orders could be used to produce larger orders at faster rates.

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            •	Scenario 1: A student has classes all day with short breaks to get and eat lunch. By using the food service app, the student can place an order during class and pick up his/her order at his/her convenience, giving time for other activities during his/her break.
        </p>
        <p>
            •	Scenario 2: A student would like to buy lunch but also has an upcoming exam. By using the food service app to order lunch he/she can continue studying for the upcoming exam using the time that he/she would have spent in line waiting to order.  
        </p>
        <p>
            •	Scenario 3: A student would like to order from a food outlet but from using the food service app the student is informed that the food outlet is closed or is out of stock of their desired item. The student would have otherwise wasted his/her time going to the food outlet or waiting in line only to find out their desired choice is unavailable.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Plan</h2>
        <p>
            This system will be implemented using a mobile application on android devices. The user will be able to look through food outlets around campus and will choose one. The user will be able to see all available items at the food outlet in real time, choose desired items and prepare an order, seeing the estimated time and cost to prepare the order. Users will be given instant feedback when orders are placed and the location of the food outlet to pick up the order. Users will also have the option of getting email notifications when orders are ready. Users will be able to make payments through the app using online payments. If users do not have access to online payment systems such credit cards the user will have the option to load their user account with funds using self-service cash registers around campus.
